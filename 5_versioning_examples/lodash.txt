Specific version:
		"lodash": "4.1.0",
		or CLI npm install lodash@4.1.0
		
Caret(' ^ ') updates to the most recent major version (the first number).  ^4.1.3 will match any 4.x.x release including 4.3.0, but will hold off on 5.0.0.  
        "lodash": "^4.1.0",
		or CLI npm install lodash@"<5.0.0"
		
Tilde (' ~' ) matches the most recent minor version (the middle number). ~4.1.0 will match all 4.1.x versions but will miss 4.2.0.  
		"lodash": "~4.1.0",

Global install:
npm i eslint -g
Global install folder:
npm list -g

globally uninstall:
npm uninstall -g package-name

Other powerful CLI tools: create-react-app, angular cli

Global isn't recommended, filling our computer with stuff we don't need.
Solution is npx:
npx eslint
makes NPM check if there's a local module in the project, and uses it if there is.  
Otherwise checks for a global module, and uses it if there is.

Very recommended to use npx and not global installation
