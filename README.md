# node-js-book
This repository contains my notes and code as I go through a Node.js programming tutorial book for the second time, created by top Israeli companies and lead developer Ran Bar Zik. 

I'm doing this to deepen my understanding and to practice my Node.js skills before contributing to or creating industry-level projects.
