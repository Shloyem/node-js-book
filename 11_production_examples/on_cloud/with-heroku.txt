I uploaded a demo project there in the past, no longer as they charge a monthly subscription.
Generally the steps are:
1. Installing Heroku CLI, signing up, logging in
2. Creating a file called procfile (no extension), with the deployment instructions. Something like:
web: node app.js
3. In the main project folder:
  3.1 Heroku create
  3.2 git push Heroku master
  3.3 heroku ps:scale web=1 // to run the app
  3.4 heroku open           // to open
4. General note, for your project to work in cloud environment
  - Don't write 
  app.listen(3000) 
  - Write instead
  const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
  app.listen(port);
